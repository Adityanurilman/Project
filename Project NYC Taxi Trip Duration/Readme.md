# Project NYC Taxi Trip Duration
Good Day everyone,

I have created a repository on Github to showcase the creation of end to end project data science. This project explain how I deep diving the data to get information and trying to soleve the problem with machine learning. In this repository, I will share the result of my exploaratory data analyst and result of study machine learning.

Have you ever wondered what factors affect the duration of taxi trips in New York City? How do weather, traffic, or distance impact your travel time?

I recently came across an interesting study on this topic for my final project bootcamp and wanted to share it with you. The study shows that factors such as traffic, distance, and number of passengers can have a significant impact on taxi trip duration in New York.

The study also demonstrates that technology, such as machine learning prediction models, can help predict taxi trip duration in the future, helping taxi drivers and passengers avoid traffic congestion and reach their destinations more efficiently.

I believe this topic is very interesting and relevant for those of us living in big cities.

Please feel free to clone or download the repository and try it out for yourself. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to reach out to me.

Thank you for your interest in this project!
